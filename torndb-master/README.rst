Torndb
======

Torndb is a simple wrapper around MySQLdb that originally appeared
in Tornado (http://www.tornadoweb.org).  It is being moved into
a separate package for Tornado 3.0.

This package is not actively maintained, and since it exists primarily
for backwards compatibility with the module provided in Tornado prior
to version 3.0, I do not intend to make major changes or merge pull
requests that do so.  You are welcome to create a fork, but pull
requests are unlikely to get merged into this repo.

Installation
------------

``pip install torndb``
